## Summary of Insights
### Plan Type:
- Each quarter, the Pro plan is the highest-earning plan, which also makes up about 50% of bookings since the beginning of 2021.
- The enterprise plan had an all-time high at the beginning of March 2020 due to the pandemic. 
- Towards the end of 2021, the middle tier (Business) severely declined, and now makes up less than 10% of the overall plan mix.

### Plan Period:
- **Yearly plans are responsible for over 95% of weekly bookings,** though the ratio of yearly to monthly plans decreased in 2021.
- Yearly plans exhibited large spikes during peak-COVID times and ** declined in the second half of 2021.**

### Plan Region:
- North America (NA) has historically made up about 50% of bookings, and EMEA and NA follow similar trends throughout 2020-2021. The entire Enterprise plan spike in 2020 was attributed to North America.
- Note that about $80K of bookings have missing region data.

## Business Recommendations 
- Investigate ways to increase the ratio of yearly vs. monthly plans, as the decline in yearly subscriptions has a greater impact than a decline in monthly subscriptions. 
- Business subscriptions dropped significantly at the end of 2021. Investigate whether there are competitors addressing this middle market and if there are new features Zoom should implement accordingly.
- North America exhibits a slightly declining share of the weekly bookings ever since the beginning of 2020. If Zoom gradually shifts to a less NA-centric market, will need to expand business analyses to include global competitors and economic factors like changes in exchange rates.
