## Summary of Insights
### Plan Type:
- Each quarter, the **Pro plan is the highest-earning plan** ($600K-$1M), while Enterprise plans earn about half of the Pro plans, and Business plans earn about half of Enterprise plans.
- In mid-2020, all plan bookings spiked, but the **Pro plan had an all-time high at $1M bookings** in the week of May 3rd.

### Plan Period:
- **Yearly plans are responsible for over 90% of weekly bookings,** though the ratio of yearly to monthly plans decreased in 2021.
- Yearly plans exhibited large spikes during peak-COVID times and **rapidly declined in the second half of 2021.**

### Plan Region:
- The EMEA region is by far the highest-earning region, making up more than 50% of global bookings until the end of 2020. This decreased to about 40% by the end of 2021.
- In 2021, LATAM and NA started making up a larger proportion of weekly bookings as EMEA bookings greatly declined.

## Business Recommendations 
- Investigate ways to increase the ratio of yearly vs. monthly plans, as the decline in yearly subscriptions has a greater impact than a decline in monthly subscriptions. 
- Business subscriptions dropped to almost $0 at the end of 2021. Investigate whether there are competitors addressing this middle market and if there are new features Zoom should implement accordingly.
- The largest drop in bookings comes from the EMEA region. Research whether lockdown policies, other technology, or cultural shifts are contributing factors.
